# LLM_bias_mitigation
# Overview
This repository explores various techniques for mitigating biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure fair and ethical AI-generated responses. The project implements multiple debiasing strategies, including:
- **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)** for bias mitigation  
- **Bias evaluation metrics** to assess fairness in models  
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for efficient fine-tuning  
- **MEMIT (Mass-Editing Memory in Transformers)** for targeted bias correction  
- **REPE (Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Engineering)** to refine model responses  
# Features
- **Comprehensive Bias Evaluation** – Tools to measure biases before and after mitigation  
- **DPO-Based Fine-Tuning** – Preference-based training to improve fairness  
- **LoRA Adaptation** – Lightweight, efficient fine-tuning for targeted corrections  
- **MEMIT Editing** – Controlling memory to reduce biased outputs  
- **REPE Strategies** – Prompt engineering to counteract model biases  
# Installation
#Clone the repository
# Usage
# 1. Evaluating Bias
Run the evaluation script to analyze the model's fairness:

```python evaluate_bias.py --model model_name```
# 2. DPO Bias Mitigation
Fine-tune a model using Direct Preference Optimization:

```python dpo_mitigation.py --model model_name --dataset dataset_path```
# 3. LoRA-Based Bias Mitigation
Apply LoRA fine-tuning to mitigate biases:

```python lora_mitigation.py --model model_name --lora_weights lora_path```
# 4. MEMIT Bias Correction
Modify memory representations to address biases:

```python memit_mitigation.py --model model_name --edit_target target_bias```
# 5. REPE Bias Mitigation
Use retrieval-augmented prompts for fairness:

```python repe_mitigation.py --model model_name --prompt_strategy strategy_type```
# Results and Benchmarking
After mitigation, run the bias evaluation script again to compare the results:

```python evaluate_bias.py --model model_name --after_mitigation```
